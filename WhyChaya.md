**WHY CHAYA-V2 IS BETTER THAN THE REST?**

- [x] 0% detection rate using most of the publically available anti-steg tools like stegexpose and many more
- [x] 100% data retention with almost the same capacity of standard LSB technique with LBS-LPS
- [x] Transparent cryptography that gets as good as python has to offer

***This project is highly secure and immune to attack, even with the use of a standard supercomputer. Unless there are vulnerabilities present in the Python libraries or the language itself, there is no feasible way to penetrate this system. The LSB-LPS method of brute-forcing would require an insurmountable amount of time, even with larger graph images, as every possible combination of X and Y coordinates must be attacked without error. The use of machine learning to accomplish this task is also highly unlikely, as it is best suited for tasks such as natural language processing. Furthermore, even if the attacker utilized NLP to determine the readable message, the ciphertext results from brute-forcing would still be ineffective in uncovering the coordinates. In the unlikely scenario that the attacker is able to determine the starting coordinates for the de-steg process, they would still have to overcome the security of AES-GCM-256 encryption. AES-GCM-256, with its combination of confidentiality and integrity, is widely regarded as the superior encryption mode and offers an additional layer of protection to this project.***
